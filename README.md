# Quarterly Provisional Estimates for Selected Birth Indicators

### The Project
This project is an initial exploration into the data surrounding birthing mothers in the United States of America. 

### Data Source
The [data](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-VSRR-Quarterly-provisional-estimates-for-sele/76vv-a7x8) used in this project was retrieved from the CDC website. 

### Next Steps
Following this project, I have decided to further explore Cesarean sections in the US. The rate of C-sections in this country is incredibly high, especially for mothers of color.
